- `dist/` - release is built into this directory.
- `src/` - our application sources. [Read more &raquo;](src/README.md)
- `test/` - test sources and configuration. [Read more &raquo;](test/README.md)
- `bower_components/` - third-party libraries. [Bower](https://bower.io) will install packages here. Anything added to this directory will need to be manually
  added to `src/index.html` and `test/karma.conf.js` to be picked up by the build system.
- `.bowerrc` - the Bower configuration file. This tells Bower to install components into the `bower_components/` directory.
- `bower.json` - this is our project configuration for Bower and it contains the list of Bower dependencies we need.
- `Gruntfile.js` - our build script.
- `package.json` - metadata about the app, used by NPM and our build script. Our NPM dependencies are listed here.
