## 7.2.3-SNAPSHOT (future release)

**Highlights**
- Support updating workflow instance business key.
- Support for searching workflow instances by state variable key and value.

**Details**
- `nflow-engine`
  - `WorkflowInstanceService.updateWorkflowInstance` can now be used to update business key of the workflow instance.
  - Use `QueryWorkflowInstances.setStateVariable` to limit search query by state variable name and key. Only the latest value of the state variable of the workflow instance is used.
- `nflow-rest-api-common`, `nflow-rest-api-jax-rs`, `nflow-rest-api-spring-web`
  - `UpdateWorkflowInstanceRequest.businessKey` field was added to support updating workflow instance business key via REST API.
  - Added support for new query parameters `stateVariableKey` and `stateVariableValue` to `GET /v1/workflow-instance` to limit search query by state variable name and key. Only the latest value of the state variable of the workflow instance is used.
- `nflow-explorer`
  - Dependency updates:
    - urijs 1.19.5
    - socket.io 2.4.1
- Database
  - Change `text` data types to `varchar(max)` for MS SQL Server

## 7.2.2 (2020-12-25)

**Highlights**
- `nflow-engine`
  - Handle exceptions if waking up parent workflow fails after updating workflow instance state.
- `nflow-explorer`
  - Remove "Save as PNG" button as it produced empty images. PR to restore functionality would be appreciated.

**Details**
- `nflow-engine`
  - Catch and log error when waking up parent workflow fails after updating workflow instance state. Failure in waking up parent workflow should not trigger a retry for the workflow instance update, as the update has already been done. As the parent is expected to handle situations where child workflow does not explicitly wake up the parent, it is ok to just log this error and continue.

## 7.2.1 (2020-12-23)

**Highlights**
- `nflow-engine`
  - Optimize fetching workflow instance with large history with many modified state variables.

- `nflow-rest-api-spring-web` and `nflow-netty`
  - Change REST API calls to use a dedicated thread pool for all blocking database operations to avoid blocking the netty EventLoop thread.

**Details**
- `nflow-engine`
  - Fix SQL performance / memory issue when getting single workflow instance with action state variables, when the instance has lots of actions with lots of state variables. The old code fetched all state variables of all actions of the instance, the new code only fetches the state variables for the actions that will be returned.
  - Fix instantiation of @StateVar(instantiateIfNotExists=true) Mutable<Type> - the result was incorrectly a Mutable wrapped in Mutable.
  - Fix potential resource leaks

## 7.2.0 (2020-04-27)

**Highlights**
- Expedited clean shutdown for workflows that run many consequtive states.
- Add support for custom logic when nFlow engine thinks the workflow state processing may be stuck.
- Convert all exceptions to proper error response messages in all nFlow REST API endpoints. Applies to both `nflow-rest-api-jax-rs` and `nflow-rest-api-spring-web`.
- Support for Guice.

**Details**
- `nflow-engine`
  - When shutdown is requested, stop processing workflows immediately after the current state has been executed.
  - Add `WorkflowExecutorLister.handlePotentiallyStuck(Duration processingTime)` to support custom handling when nFlow engine thinks the workflow state processing may be stuck. If any registered listener implementation returns true from this method, nFlow will interrupt the processing thread. The default implementation returns false.
  - Throw `IllegalArgumentException` instead of `IllegalStateException` when trying to update workflow instance state to an invalid value.
  - Throw `IllegalArugmentException` instead of `RuntimeException` when trying to insert workflow instance with unknown type or with a state that is not a start state.
  - Make `StateVariableTooLongException` extend `IllegalArgumentException` instead of `RuntimeException`.
  - Fix SQL deadlocks in workflow instance polling for PostgreSQL with skip locked.
  - Add `EngineEnvironmentModule` and `EngineModule` for Guice support. Call `NflowController.start()` and `NflowController.stop()` to start and stop nFlow engine, as `nflow.autostart` and `nflow.autoinit` configuration options are not supported with Guice.
  - MySQL/MariaDB: use compressed table format for archives.
  - PostgreSQL/SQLServer: use partial (not null) indices for parent hierarchy.
  - PostgreSQL: tune fillfactors of tables and indices.
  - PostgreSQL: reorder table column order to minimize space lost on padding. Only affects new tables.
  - Drop `(type, external_id, executor_group)` unique constraint from `nflow_archive_workflow` table. Allows archiving workflow instances with same values multiple times. Only one instance is allowed in production table though.
  - Dependency updates:
    - spring 5.2.5

    - grunt-contrib-imagemin 4.0.0

## 7.1.0 (2020-03-25)

**Highlights**
- `nflow-engine`
  - Add support for marking exceptions and workflow states as non-retryable. If processing the state method throws an exception, nFlow engine will check if it
    is allowed to retry. If not, the workflow instance will go directly to a failure/error state. See `NoRetryWorkflow` for example.

**Details**
- `nflow-engine`
  - Exceptions can be annotated with `@NonRetryable` to prevent retrying the state processing.
  - Add `isRetryable(Throwable thrown)` method to the `WorkflowState` interface with a default implementation that returns true when the thrown exception is not
    annotated with `@NonRetryable`.
  - Add default implementation for `WorkflowState.getDescription()` that returns the name of the state.

## 7.0.0 (2020-03-05)

**BREAKING CHANGES**
  - Drop `nflow_workflow.root_workflow_id` column.
  - Remove, add and update foreign key constraints and indices in nFlow database tables.
  - `ArchiveService` and `ArchiveResource` (`/v1/archive`) are replaced by `MaintenanceService` and `MaintenanceResource` (`/v1/maintenance`).
  - Change `WorkflowSettings.setHistoryDeleteableAfterHours(Integer)` to `WorkflowSettings.setHistoryDeleteableAfter(ReadablePeriod)` for more flexible configuration.
  - `StateExecution.getAllChildWorkflows` does not return current state variables of child workflows anymore.
  - `WorkflowStateProcessor` does not read child workflow IDs of processed workflow instances anymore.
  - `QueryWorkflowInstances.Builder` does not query for current state variables by default anymore.
  - `BulkWorklow` moved to `io.nflow.engine.workflow.curated` java package.

**Highlights**
- `nflow-engine`
  - Improve workflow instance archiving performance. Archiving has been in practice unusable in some scenarios.
  - Add support for deleting workflow instances, actions and state variables from production and archive tables.
  - Remove support for `nflow.executor.fetchChildWorkflowIds` configuration property.
  - Fix bug in stuck workflow instance processing detection when multiple states are processed consecutively by the same processor thread. Now the time counter is reset between each state.
  - Added abstract `CronWorkflow` that can be used to periodically execute a task.
  - Built-in support for periodically running maintenance to clean up workflow instances.

**Details**
- `nflow-engine`
  - `nflow_workflow.root_workflow_id` was only used in old archiving code, so it was removed as the new archiving logic does not need it anymore.
  - Removed unnecessary indices and foreign keys and added missing indices to improve nFlow database performance. See database update scripts for details.
  - Added name for all existing and new constraints in create scripts, if they did not have one yet. This is to make modify operations easier in future. All of these may not be covered in database update scripts.
  - See `MaintenanceService` and `MaintenanceConfiguration` for details on how to archive and delete workflow instances. The maintenance operations can now be limited by workflow type as well.
  - As ArchiveService is removed, the old functionality of `ArchiveService.archiveWorkflows(DateTime olderThan, int batchSize)` can now be achieved with
    `MaintenanceService.cleanupWorkflows(new MaintenanceConfiguration.Builder()
      .setArchiveWorkflows(new ConfigurationItem.Builder()
        .setOlderThanPeriod(new Period(olderThan, DateTime.now())
        .setBatchSize(batchSize)
        .build())
      .build)`
  - For example, `WorkflowSettings.setHistoryDeleteableAfterHours(12)` can now be achieved by `WorkflowSettings.setHistoryDeleteableAfter(Period.hours(12))`.
  - To get child workflows with state variables in a state method, use `StateExecution.queryChildWorkflows`.
  - To get all child workflow IDs in a state method, use `StateExecution.getAllChildWorkflows`.
  - New `MaintenanceWorkflow` that can be enabled by setting `nflow.maintenance.insertWorkflowIfMissing` property to true. On the first run the workflow is inserted and it will start to run periodically. Further configuration must be done by editing the two state variables of the workflow: `cron` for the scheduling and `config` for the `MaintenanceConfiguration` to execute.
    - The first time configuration can also be tuned with `nflow.maintenance.initial.cron`, `nflow.maintenance.initial.delete.olderThan`, `nflow.maintenance.initial.archive.olderThan` and `nflow.maintenance.initial.deleteArchived.olderThan`

## 6.2.0 (2020-02-11)

**Highlights**
- `nflow-engine`
  - Improve child workflow final state execution speed by caching the parent workflow type. See configuration details below.
  - Add optional performance improvement to state execution. See configuration details below.
  - Optimize workflow instance polling code.

**Details**
- `nflow-engine`
  - Workflow type cache size can be set using `nflow.db.workflowInstanceType.cacheSize` property. Default is 10000.
  - Set property `nflow.executor.fetchChildWorkflowIds` to `false` (recommended) to avoid reading child workflow IDs when executing a state. If access to child workflow instances is needed, they can be fetched using `StateExecution` interface. This will be the default in 7.0.0 release.
  - Automatically disable batch updates if batch update returns unsupported values.
  - Fetch optimistic locked list of workflow instance IDs in a separate transaction from the modify phase. This should reduce the risk of deadlocks in databases.
  - Tune batch status handling to consider status a failure if more than one row were modified.

  - spotbugs-annotations 4.0.0-RC3
  - mssql 8.2.0.jre8
  - jetty 9.4.26.v20200117

  - postgresql 42.2.10
  - hibernate-validator 6.1.2.Final
- Maven plugin updates:
  - spotbugs 4.0.0-RC3

## 6.1.0 (2020-01-23)

**Highlights**
- `nflow-engine`
  - Check that state variable value fits into the database column
  - Fix performance problems when querying workflows by only fetching state variables when requested

**Details**
- `nflow-engine`
  - Verify on startup that connections returned by `DataSource` used by nFlow have auto commit enabled. nFlow may not work correctly without it.
  - Throw `StateVariableValueTooLongException` if a state variable value that does not fit into the database column is detected. Checked in `StateExecution.setVariable`, `StateExecution.addWorkflows`, `StateExecution.addChildWorkflows`, `WorkflowInstanceService.insertWorkflowInstance` and when creating a new or updating an existing instance via REST API.
    If the exception is thrown during state processing and not handled by the state implementation, nFlow engine will catch the exception and retry state processing after delay configured by property `nflow.executor.stateVariableValueTooLongRetryDelay.minutes` (default is 60).
  - Fix honoring of `includeCurrentStateVariables` flag in `WorkflowInstanceService.listWorkflowInstances`. This caused major slowness when using bulk workflows.
    To preserve the existing (incorrect) default behaviour in backwards compatible way the default value in `QueryWorkflowInstances.Builder` is changed to `true`. The REST API is unaffected.
    Especially in workflows with many children that use the `StateExecution.getAllChildWorkflows` method the performance impact can be high. Before 7.0.0 release, it is recommended to use `StateExecution.queryChildWorkflows(new QueryWorkflowInstances.Builder().setIncludeCurrentStateVariables(false).build())` if state variables are not needed.

## 6.0.0 (2019-11-26)

**Highlights**
- Add priority to workflow instances
- Use constructor injection instead of field or setter injection in nFlow classes
- Separate workflow definition scanning from `WorkflowDefinitionService`
- Remove deprecated `WorkflowInstanceInclude.STARTED` enum value
- Remove deprecated `AbstractWorkflowExecutorListener`, use `WorkflowExecutorListener` instead
- Remove deprecated `WorkflowInstance.setStarted`, use `WorkflowInstance.setStartedIfNotSet` instead
- Add MariaDB support
- Add Kotlin example using nFlow with Spring Boot, and integrated nFlow Explorer
- Expose wakeup via REST-API
- Update database indices to match workflow instance polling code
- Add new configuration option `nflow.db.disable_batch_updates` to work around some Galera oddities

**Details**
- `nflow-engine`
  - Add `priority` two byte integer to the `nflow_workflow` table. When the dispatcher chooses from many available scheduled workflow instances it primarily (unfairly) picks the workflow instances with the largest priority values, and for workflows with the same priority, the ones with oldest `next_activation` timestamp. Priority defaults to 0 and can also be negative. Default priority value for the new workflow instances can be set per workflow definition (`WorkflowSettings.Builder.setDefaultPriority`), and overridden per workflow instance (`WorkflowInstance.Builder.setPriority`). Requires database migration, see database update scripts for details.
  - Separate workflow definition scanning from `WorkflowDefinitionService` by introducing `WorkflowDefinitionSpringBeanScanner` and `WorkflowDefinitionClassNameScanner`. This allows breaking the circular dependency when a workflow definition uses `WorkflowInstanceService` (which depends on `WorkflowDefinitionService`, which depended on all workflow definitions). This enabled using constructor injection in all nFlow classes.
  - Add `disableMariaDbDriver` to default MySQL JDBC URL so that in case there are both MySQL and MariaDB JDBC drivers in the classpath then MariaDB will not steal the MySQL URL.
  - Add support for `nflow.db.mariadb` profile.
  - Update database indices to match current workflow instance polling code.
  - Create indices for foreign keys in MS SQL database.
  - Fix create database scripts to work with empty database.
  - Add `nflow.db.disable_batch_updates` (default `false`) configuration parameter to make it possible to force use of multiple updates even if batch updates are supported by the database. This is needed on some Galera systems that cannot handle batch updates correctly.

- Improve error logging in WorkflowStateProcessor.
- Replace FindBugs with SpotBugs.
- Drop index from main table that was only used for archiving purposes.
- Increase workflow instance and action identifiers in code to 64 bits for future proofing. Database schema is not changed for now, but the columns can be altered later (to bigints) if needed.

## 5.7.0 (2019-06-06)

**Highlights**
- Added `started` timestamp to workflow instance table (requires database update)
- Deprecated WorkflowInstanceInclude.STARTED enum value
- Deprecated `AbstractWorkflowExecutorListener`, use `WorkflowExecutorListener` instead
- Allow easily starting nflow-engine for embedding via `NflowEngine` class
- Added `WorkflowLogContextListener` for setting generic workflow properties to SLF4J log context and logging state variables when processing any state of any workflow instance

**Details**
- `nflow-engine`
  - Add started timestamp to workflow instance table. This makes the instance queries much faster when instances have lots of actions, as there is no need to join the nflow_workflow_action table to the query anymore.
  - Deprecated WorkflowInstanceInclude.STARTED enum value. This is not needed anymore, since the started timestamp is always read from the database when the instance is loaded.
  - Moved default implementations for `WorkflowExecutorListener` interface methods from the abstract class to the interface.
  - Fixed bug with dropping non-existent index in PostgreSQL create script.

## 5.6.0 (2019-05-21)

**Highlights**
- Support non-enum WorkflowStates to enable, for example, Kotlin workflow definitions by extending AbstractWorkflowDefinition.

**Details**
- Dependency and plugin updates:
  - spring 5.1.6.RELEASE
  - reactor.netty 0.8.6.RELEASE
  - jetty 9.4.17.v20190418
- `nflow-engine`
  - Retry workflow state processing until all steps in nFlow-side are executed successfully. This will prevent workflow instances from being locked in `executing` status, if e.g. database connection fails after locking the instance and before querying the full workflow instance information (`WorkflowStateProcessor`).
  - Fix #306: create empty ArrayList with default initial size.
  - Log more executor details on startup.
  - Fix #311: Replace references to WorkflowDefinition with AbstractWorkflowDefinition to support non-enum WorkflowStates
  - Use name() instead of toString() when getting workflow instance initial state name.

## 5.5.0 (2019-04-04)

**CRITICAL BUG**
This release contains a bug (#306, introduced in 5.4.1) which may cause OutOfMemory errors while fetching child workflow IDs. We recommend to update to 5.6.0 as soon as possible.

**Highlights**
- Introduce possibility to temporarily stop polling for new workflow instances by invoking pause() on WorkflowLifecycle, continue polling with resume(), and check pause status with isPaused().

**Details**
- Update libraries for nFlow Explorer. Includes fix for morgan library security issue.
  - https://github.com/NitorCreations/nflow/network/alert/nflow-explorer/package-lock.json/morgan/open
- Fix travis build to actually run unit tests for nflow-explorer module.
- Add pause(), resume() and isPaused() to WorkflowLifecycle, to pause and resume workflow instance polling in a running nFlow.

## 5.4.1 (2019-03-18)

**CRITICAL BUG**
This release introduced issue #306 which may cause OutOfMemory errors while fetching child workflow IDs. We recommend to update to 5.6.0 as soon as possible.

**Highlights**
- Introduce BulkWorkflow which can be used or extended to handle mass of child workflows without overloading the system.
- Introduce new workflow instance state type `wait`. Child workflow instances automatically wake up the parent when the parent is in a `wait` state and the child enters an `end` state.
- Allow creating workflows via REST API with null activation time (by setting `activate = false`).
- Allow creating child workflows via REST API (by setting `parentWorkflowId`).

**Details**
- See `BulkWorkflowTest` and `DemoBulkWorkflow` for examples on how to use bulk workflows
- Support boxed primitives (Integer, Float etc) with @StateVar
- nFlow Explorer: Library updates to `lodash` 4.17.11, `moment` 2.24.0 and `extend` 3.0.2
  Earlier lodash versions had this security vulnerability: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16487

- nFlow Explorer: Executors page to use standard time formatting in tooltips
- nFlow netty: Add support for registering Spring ApplicationListeners
- nFlow jetty: Replace deprecated NCSARequestLog with CustomRequestLog
- Fix `WorkflowLifecycle.stop()` blocking forever if `nflow.autostart=false` and `WorkflowLifecycle.start()` not called

## 5.3.3 (2019-02-04)

**Details**
- Build using correct Java class version (was broken in 5.3.2)

## 5.3.2 (2019-02-04)

**Details**
- Fix workflow history cleanup to work also with MySQL 5.7
- Upgraded Spring to version 5.1.4.RELEASE

## 5.3.1 (2019-01-13)

**Details**
- Expose workflow instance history cleanup delay in REST API and show it in Explorer (workflow definition -> settings)
- Preserve actions that are parent actions for child workflows in workflow history cleanup (otherwise cascade foreign key deletes also the children)

## 5.3.0 (2019-01-03)

**Highlights**
- Add experimental DB2 support

**Breaking changes**
- nFlow `Datasource` uses now underlying database specific `Driver`s instead of `DataSource`s.
  Make a corresponding change, if you have customized `nflow.db.*.driver` parameters.

**Details**
- Popup notifications from workflow instance updates, network and authentication issues in Explorer
- Upgraded Spring to version 5.1.3.RELEASE
- Workflow instance history (actions, states) cleanup as part of state processing, configurable through `WorkflowSettings`

## 5.2.0 (2018-11-20)

**Highlights**
- Add `stopped` field to executor data. In database, REST API and nFlow Explorer. Requires database migration.
- Support Azure AD authentication in Explorer (see `nflow-explorer/src/config.js` for configuration options)

**Details**

## 5.0.1 (2018-09-14)

**Highlights**
- Use [nFlow Explorer version 1.2.8](https://github.com/NitorCreations/nflow-explorer/releases/tag/v1.2.8)

## 5.0.0 (2018-09-11)

**Highlights**
- Fix to work with Spring Boot 2.x and Spring 5.x
- Support for MS SQL database
- Support REST API based on spring-web in addition to JAX-RS.
- Experimental support for the [Netty server](https://netty.io/)

**Breaking changes**
- Renamed JAX-RS REST API project from `nflow-rest-api` to `nflow-rest-api-jax-rs`.
  - By default, the JAX-RS paths were changed from `/nflow/v1/*` to `/v1/*`.
- `nflow-jetty` now serves all paths under `/nflow/*`. The new paths are as follows:
  - /nflow/api/v1           -> API v1 (was: /api/nflow/v1)
  - /nflow/api/swagger.json -> Swagger config (was: /api/swagger.json)
  - /nflow/ui               -> nFlow statics assets
  - /nflow/ui/explorer      -> nFlow UI (was: /explorer)
  - /nflow/ui/doc           -> Swagger UI (was: /doc)
  - /nflow/metrics          -> metrics and health checks (was: /metrics)
- Removed the following `nflow-jetty` configuration properties:
  - `nflow.swagger.basepath`
  - `nflow.api.basepath`
- `nflow-jetty` Swagger UI no longer by default searches the entire classpath for Swagger annotations.
  - The behaviour can be controlled via the parameter `nflow.swagger.packages`.

**Details**
- Split nflow-rest-api into `nflow-rest-api-jax-rs` and `nflow-rest-api-spring-web` to reflect the targeted framework
- Add configuration parameter `nflow.autoinit` (defaults to true) that can be used to prevent database access on Spring inialization.
- `nflow-rest-api-jax-rs`:
  - Change endpoint paths for workflow instance: /v1/workflow-instance/{id} -> /v1/workflow-instance/id/{id}
- `nflow-server-common`:
  - Use nFlow Explorer version 1.2.7 (nFlow REST API path changes)
- Experimental new module `nflow-netty`
  - Based on [Spring WebFlux](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux) and Netty.
  - Serves a limited subset of `nflow-jetty` paths with REST API under `/nflow/api/v1` and nflow explorer under `/nflow/ui/explorer`.
- `nflow-jetty`
  - Added configuration parameter `nflow.swagger.packages` (defaults to `io.nflow.rest`), that controls which packages are searched for Swagger annotations.
  - Removed parameters `nflow.swagger.basepath` and `nflow.api.basepath` as everything is now prefixed under `/nflow/*`, which should remove the need to control the basepaths.
