## 5.5.1-SNAPSHOT (future release)

**Details**
- Dependency and plugin updates:
   - spring 5.1.6.RELEASE
   - reactor.netty 0.8.6.RELEASE
   - jetty 9.4.17.v20190418
- `nflow-engine`
  - Retry workflow state processing until all steps in nFlow-side are executed successfully. This will prevent workflow instances from being locked in `executing` status, if e.g. database connection fails after locking the instance and before querying the full workflow instance information (`WorkflowStateProcessor`).
  - Fix #306: create empty ArrayList with default initial size
  - Log more executor details on startup  
  
## 5.5.0 (2019-04-04)

**Highlights**
- Introduce possibility to temporarily stop polling for new workflow instances by invoking pause() on WorkflowLifecycle, continue polling with resume(), and check pause status with isPaused().

**Details**
- Update libraries for nFlow Explorer. Includes fix for morgan library security issue.
  - https://github.com/NitorCreations/nflow/network/alert/nflow-explorer/package-lock.json/morgan/open
- Fix travis build to actually run unit tests for nflow-explorer module.
- Add pause(), resume() and isPaused() to WorkflowLifecycle, to pause and resume workflow instance polling in a running nFlow.

## 5.4.1 (2019-03-18)

**Highlights**

- Allow creating workflows via REST API with null activation time (by setting `activate = false`).

- Support boxed primitives (Integer, Float etc) with @StateVar
- nFlow Explorer: Library updates to `lodash` 4.17.11, `moment` 2.24.0 and `extend` 3.0.2
  Earlier lodash versions had this security vulnerability: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16487

## 5.3.2 (2019-02-04)

**Details**
- Fix workflow history cleanup to work also with MySQL 5.7
- Upgraded Spring to version 5.1.4.RELEASE

## 5.3.1 (2019-01-13)

**Details**
- Expose workflow instance history cleanup delay in REST API and show it in Explorer (workflow definition -> settings)

## 5.3.0 (2019-01-03)

**Highlights**
- Add experimental DB2 support

**Breaking changes**
- nFlow `Datasource` uses now underlying database specific `Driver`s instead of `DataSource`s.

**Details**
- Popup notifications from workflow instance updates, network and authentication issues in Explorer
- Upgraded Spring to version 5.1.3.RELEASE
- Workflow instance history (actions, states) cleanup as part of state processing, configurable through `WorkflowSettings`

## 5.2.0 (2018-11-20)

- Support Azure AD authentication in Explorer (see `nflow-explorer/src/config.js` for configuration options)

**Details**
- Travis CI no longer runs tests with Oracle JDK 10. Only oraclejdk8 and openjdk11 are currently running Travis CI tests.

- nflow-netty's StartNflow interface changed to match nflow-jetty's

## 5.0.1 (2018-09-14)

**Highlights**
- Use [nFlow Explorer version 1.2.8](https://github.com/NitorCreations/nflow-explorer/releases/tag/v1.2.8)

**Highlights**
- Fix to work with Spring Boot 2.x and Spring 5.x
- Support for MS SQL database
- Support REST API based on spring-web in addition to JAX-RS.
- Experimental support for the [Netty server](https://netty.io/)

**Breaking changes**
- Renamed JAX-RS REST API project from `nflow-rest-api` to `nflow-rest-api-jax-rs`.
  - By default, the JAX-RS paths were changed from `/nflow/v1/*` to `/v1/*`.
- `nflow-jetty` now serves all paths under `/nflow/*`. The new paths are as follows:
  - /nflow/api/v1           -> API v1 (was: /api/nflow/v1)
  - /nflow/api/swagger.json -> Swagger config (was: /api/swagger.json)
  - /nflow/ui               -> nFlow statics assets 
  - /nflow/ui/explorer      -> nFlow UI (was: /explorer)
  - /nflow/ui/doc           -> Swagger UI (was: /doc)
  - /nflow/metrics          -> metrics and health checks (was: /metrics)
- Removed the following `nflow-jetty` configuration properties:
  - `nflow.swagger.basepath`
  - `nflow.api.basepath`
- `nflow-jetty` Swagger UI no longer by default searches the entire classpath for Swagger annotations.
  - The behaviour can be controlled via the parameter `nflow.swagger.packages`.

**Details**
- Split nflow-rest-api into `nflow-rest-api-jax-rs` and `nflow-rest-api-spring-web` to reflect the targeted framework
- Add configuration parameter `nflow.autoinit` (defaults to true) that can be used to prevent database access on Spring inialization.
- `nflow-rest-api-jax-rs`:
  - Change endpoint paths for workflow instance: /v1/workflow-instance/{id} -> /v1/workflow-instance/id/{id}
- `nflow-server-common`:
  - Use nFlow Explorer version 1.2.7 (nFlow REST API path changes)
- Experimental new module `nflow-netty`
  - Based on [Spring WebFlux](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux) and Netty.
  - Serves a limited subset of `nflow-jetty` paths with REST API under `/nflow/api/v1` and nflow explorer under `/nflow/ui/explorer`.
- `nflow-jetty`
  - Added configuration parameter `nflow.swagger.packages` (defaults to `io.nflow.rest`), that controls which packages are searched for Swagger annotations.
  - Removed parameters `nflow.swagger.basepath` and `nflow.api.basepath` as everything is now prefixed under `/nflow/*`, which should remove the need to control the basepaths.
